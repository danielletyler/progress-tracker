# On Track

## General Information

One of my favorite practices for staying on top of my work is setting personal deadlines for assignments. This lets me know I am staying on track and getting things done on time. To facilitate this, I decided to design my ideal progress tracking workspace for my final year at LSU and that's exactly what On Track is.
